# Measuring local biodiversity with Diversity Measures at Distance

Summary of the article. This study introduces a new class of biodiversity measurement - the Diversity Measures at Distance - which enables diversity evaluation at any scale of observation and provides interpretative values of the results. The new class of measures are based on geolocalized data and quantify local diversity very precisely. Diversity values are interpreted using the Hill numbers (Hill, 1973). We propose visualizing the results by plotting them in a detailed and intelligible map of the local diversity at a chosen scale. After introducing our methodology, we conduct the first application as a proof of concept, measuring the local biodiversity in the Parc des Buttes Chaumont in Paris. Our proposed application illustrates the great potential of this new approach and paves the way for future research. Results and maps of local biodiversity levels are provided in addition to data and R code for reproducible research.
